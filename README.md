# Cardano Ledger App

Cardano Ledger App for Ledger Nano S

* Ledger ed25519 derivation and keys (Not Cardano implementation)
* CBOR decode transactions
* Blake2b hashing of Tx for signing

Please read the [current issues](https://github.com/HiddenField/ledger-cardano-app/wiki) on the wiki.

## Companion APIs

This app is compatible with [this fork](https://github.com/HiddenField/cardano-ledger-node-js-api) of the **cardano-ledger-node-js-api** client.

## Current Instruction Set

Instruction | APDU | Build | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
INS_GET_PUBLIC_KEY | 0x01 | PROD | Get Public Key for a given derivation index
INS_SET_TX | 0x02 | PROD | Set the transaction to be signed
INS_SIGN_TX | 0x03 | PROD | Sign transaction with a given index
INS_APP_INFO | 0x04 | PROD | Returns the app version numbering
INS_BLAKE2B_TEST | 0x07 | TEST | Hash a given value
INS_BASE58_ENCODE_TEST | 0x08 | TEST | Base58 encode a given value
INS_CBOR_DECODE_TEST | 0x09 | TEST | Decode a given transaction

## Detailed APDU Breakdown

See [doc/cardanoapp.asc](doc/cardanoapp.asc)

## Building

Make sure to delete any existing Cardano app off the device first.

`make delete`

### Production

`make clean load`

Build the app with the PROD API only.

### Test API

`make clean test`

Builds the app with the TEST API only. Useful for testing underlying implementations used in the production functions.

### Headless API - Non production

`make clean headless`

Build the PROD API bypassing the UI. [**WARNING!** Bypasses user confirmation screens. Not to be used for production builds].

### Deploying Release

Releases will need to be given to Ledger for signing with their private key.
This will allow the application to be installed via the Ledger App Manager without warning prompts on any Ledger device.

## Setup

**NOTE: There are known issues with the current LedgerBlue python sdk (described below) that can cause errors in these steps.** Please ensure you are using the correct version of the SDK.  [See - Known Issues](#known-issues).

Environment setup and developer documentation is succinctly provided in Ledger’s [Read the Docs](http://ledger.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Fix’s Vagrant project is also very useful for setting up development environments off linux using [Ledger Vagrant](https://github.com/fix/ledger-vagrant).

### Mac OSX

To set up your environment on Mac, using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) is recommended.


1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/):

  ```bash
    brew cask install virtualbox
    # This is required for USB support
    brew cask install virtualbox-extension-pack
    brew cask install vagrant
  ```

2. Clone the [ledger-vagrant](https://github.com/fix/ledger-vagrant) project and bring up the vagrant machine:

  ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:fix/ledger-vagrant.git
    cd ledger-vagrant
    vagrant up
  ```
3. Clone the application onto you machine

  ```bash
    # Where the application is cloned to is called LEDGER_CARDANO_HOME
    # For testers and developers we would advise you to clone straight into the Vagrant VM's app folder      
    git clone [CLONE_URL_OF_GIT_REPOSITORY]
  ```

4. Copying your code into the VM is done via the `apps` directory which is synced in Vagrant:

	```bash
  	cd ledger-vagrant
  	cp -r [LEDGER_CARDANO_HOME] ./apps/
	```

5. SSH into the Vagrant VM

	```bash
  	# get the ID of the machine first
  	vagrant global-status
  	vagrant ssh [ID]
    # You are now on the VM - note the prompt change
    vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$
	```

6. Setup Custom CA - These commands are run inside the Vagrant VM (vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$)
  To remove the user warnings when installing, running and deleting the app from the Ledger device, you need to generate a Custom CA keypair.
  ```bash
    cd ~/apps/ledger-cardano-app
    python -m ledgerblue.genCAPair
  ```
  This command will output the keypair onto the screen. Highlight the private key (after the colon) - Command + C
  ```bash
    Public key: 04180cf57eb2afc56ea26cc13a3a01839943a03b40d32110d401553a78a814b40b3c863f96e04f9a7710335fe920b3d0bec21529480341b381b21d7bc617b02160
    Private key: d30b3e3d25dc84cec995d1163b21a970e32879a728eccf29fd455b9a70cbc3d1
  ```
  Save private key into file sign.key in root directory
  ```bash
    touch sign.key
    echo [PASTE PRIVATE KEY] > sign.key
    cat sign.key
    # You should see the output of the private key
    d30b3e3d25dc84cec995d1163b21a970e32879a728eccf29fd455b9a70cbc3d1
  ```
  Load public key onto Ledger device:
  ```bash
    cd ~/apps/ledger-cardano-app
    python -m ledgerblue.setupCustomCA --targetId 0x31100002 --name HiddenField --public [PUBLIC KEY]
  ```  

7. To deploy, simply run

	```bash    
  	cd apps/ledger-cardano-app
    # Delete the current application if you are testing/building a different version
    make delete
    # Build and load the application onto the Nano S
  	vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ make clean load
	```
8. To build test build and deploy:

  ```bash    
    # Same as normal build above, but instead:
    make clean test
  ```

9. Shutdown VM - You must exit the VM in order for the host machine to regain visibility of the Ledger device.

  ```bash
    exit
  ```

### Known Issues

* At present, the Vagrant setup does not include adding the ARM toolchain to the path, which is required for compilation. This can be resolved by adding the following to `~/.bashrc`:

	```bash
	export ARM_HOME=/opt/bolos/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_3-2016q1
	export PATH=$PATH:$ARM_HOME/bin
	```
* There is an issue with [ledgerblue](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/blue-loader-python) 0.1.16 which causes installation to fail. If this occurs, simply install 0.1.15 using the following:

	```bash
	sudo pip uninstall ledgerblue
	# Or, if this fails, remove manually:
	rm -rf /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-package/ledgerblue*

	sudo pip install ledgerblue==0.1.15
	```

* When the Vagrant VM is running you do not have access to the Ledger device on the host machine. You need to shutdown the VM first.

[1] *Note that this is because Docker for Mac does not support USB connectivity due to [xhyve limitations](https://github.com/mist64/xhyve#what-is-bhyve)*

## Deploying

The build process is managed with [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

### Make Commands

* `clean`: Clean the build and output directories
* `delete`: Remove the application from the device
* `load`: Load signed app onto the Ledger device with regular api
* `test`: Load signed app onto the Ledger device with test api
* `build`: Build obj and bin api artefacts without loading
* `build-test`: Build obj and bin test api artefacts without loading
* `sign`: Sign current app.hex with CA private key
* `deploy`: Load the current app.hex onto the Ledger device
* `seed` : Seeds identity 1 on the device to a predetermined mnemonic. Intended for automated testing purposes. [**WARNING!** This will overwrite the identity on the device]

See `Makefile` for list of included functions.

## Development Cycle

`$ vagrant up` Start the vm
`$ vagrant ssh` SSH into the vm
`vagrant~$ cd [GIT_REPO_DIR]` goto app dir
`vagrant~$ make delete` delete previous app off device
`vagrant~$ make clean load` or `$> make clean test` or `$> make clean headless`
`vagrant~$ exit` exit ssh session
`$ vagrant suspend` suspend vm, get usb host back

Use clean when switching between development and testing APIs to ensure correct interfaces are built.

## Troubleshooting

### make delete/load/test/headless

* `ledgerblue.commException.CommException: Exception : No dongle found
make: *** [load] Error 1` : Device not unlocked; Device not connected; VM does not have control of USB port

### make load/test/headless

* `ledgerblue.commException.CommException: Exception : Invalid status 6a80`: Cardano app already installed on device - run `make delete`

### make delete
`Invalid status 6e00`: App is running
